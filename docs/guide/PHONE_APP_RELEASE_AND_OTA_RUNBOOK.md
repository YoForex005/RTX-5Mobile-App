# Phone App Release and OTA Runbook

Use this file when you want to update the RTX5 mobile app in the future.

## Current Setup

- Real app folder: `rtx5-app`
- Expo project owner: `chinese-hedger`
- Expo project slug: `rtx5-app`
- OTA system: Expo EAS Update through `expo-updates`
- Runtime version policy: `fingerprint`
- Current native config version: see `rtx5-app/app.json`
- Current OTA display version: see `rtx5-app/src/config/appDisplayVersion.ts`
- Update URL: `https://u.expo.dev/092a58db-dea9-469a-a383-f27300598812`
- OTA channels:
  - `preview`
  - `staging`
  - `production`
- GitHub production OTA branch: `release`
- GitHub secret required for OTA: `EXPO_TOKEN`
- Required EAS environment names for every OTA channel:
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_BROKER_DIRECTORY_BASE_URL`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEMO_API_BASE_URL`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_FEED_BROKER_TOKEN`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_TERMS_URL`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL`

## What Is Already Done

- OTA is enabled in `rtx5-app/app.json`.
- `expo-updates` is installed.
- `rtx5-app/eas.json` has `preview`, `staging`, and `production` channels.
- GitHub workflow `RTX5 OTA Update` is present in `.github/workflows/eas-update.yml`.
- GitHub secret `EXPO_TOKEN` has been added.
- GitHub `release` branch has been created.
- Manual GitHub OTA workflow was tested successfully on the `production` channel.

## Important Rule

OTA does not upload a new app to Play Store or App Store.

OTA publishes JavaScript and bundled asset changes to Expo. Users who already installed the compatible app build receive the update when they open or restart the app.

With `runtimeVersion.policy: fingerprint`, a normal OTA must publish to the fingerprint that Expo resolves from the current source. Do not use `RTX5_FORCE_RUNTIME_VERSION` to push new source into an older binary. That bypasses the safety gate. Use it only for an explicitly approved rollback to a known compatible update.

If the current resolved fingerprint differs from the installed binary fingerprint, either the installed binary is old or the current source has native/config/dependency changes. Compare against the binary commit first. If native-impacting files changed, make a new binary build.

## When OTA Is Allowed

Use OTA for:

- Screen/UI changes.
- TypeScript/JavaScript logic changes.
- Bug fixes in React Native code.
- Bundled image/asset changes that do not require native config changes.

Do not use OTA for:

- `app.json` native config changes.
- `eas.json` changes.
- `package.json` or `package-lock.json` dependency changes.
- Android/iOS native folder changes.
- Native permissions.
- App icon/splash/native asset config changes.
- Runtime version or app version changes.

If any of those native-sensitive files change, create a new production build and submit it to the stores.

## Future Production OTA Using GitHub

Follow these steps when the change is OTA-safe.

1. Open PowerShell in the project root.

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ADMIN\RTX-5Mobile-App
   ```

2. Make sure you are on the `release` branch.

   ```powershell
   git switch release
   ```

3. Check changed files.

   ```powershell
   git status --short
   ```

4. Do not commit random screenshots or temporary files.

   Avoid files like:

   ```text
   assets/image copy*.png
   .codex-tmp/**
   ```

5. Run checks before pushing.

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ADMIN\RTX-5Mobile-App\rtx5-app
   npm run typecheck
   node .\scripts\ota\check-eas-env.js production
   node .\scripts\ota\check-ota-safety.js --base <installed-binary-git-sha>
   node .\scripts\ota\print-update-context.js --channel production
   npx expo-doctor
   ```

6. Go back to repo root.

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ADMIN\RTX-5Mobile-App
   ```

7. Add only the files you intentionally changed.

   Example:

   ```powershell
   git add rtx5-app/src rtx5-app/app docs/guide
   ```

8. Commit the change.

   ```powershell
   git commit -m "Production OTA update"
   ```

9. Push to `release`.

   ```powershell
   git push origin release
   ```

10. Open GitHub Actions.

    ```text
    https://github.com/YoForex005/RTX-5Mobile-App/actions
    ```

11. Click `RTX5 OTA Update`.

12. Confirm the latest run is green/success.

If the run succeeds, the production OTA has been published.

## Manual GitHub OTA

Use this if you want to manually start OTA from the GitHub website.

1. Open:

   ```text
   https://github.com/YoForex005/RTX-5Mobile-App/actions
   ```

2. Click `RTX5 OTA Update`.

3. Click `Run workflow`.

4. Select:

   ```text
   Branch: release
   EAS Update channel: production
   Platform: all
   ```

5. Enter message:

   ```text
   Production OTA update
   ```

6. Click the green `Run workflow` button.

7. Wait for success.

## Direct Expo OTA Fallback

Use this if GitHub is not working and you want to publish from this computer.

1. Open PowerShell.

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ADMIN\RTX-5Mobile-App\rtx5-app
   ```

2. Confirm Expo login.

   ```powershell
   npx eas-cli@latest whoami
   ```

3. Run checks.

   ```powershell
   npm run typecheck
   npx expo-doctor
   ```

4. Publish production OTA.

   ```powershell
   $env:RTX5_OTA_BASE_REF="<installed-binary-git-sha>"
   npm run update:prod -- --message "production $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
   ```

   The wrapper uses `--environment production`, checks required EAS env names, prints Android/iOS runtime context, and blocks production OTA if native-impacting files changed since the installed binary commit.

   Preview and staging must have their own EAS environment variables before they can be used for production-parity testing. If `node .\scripts\ota\check-eas-env.js preview` fails, do not trust preview OTA behavior.

## Production Store Build

Use this when OTA is not enough.

1. Open PowerShell.

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ADMIN\RTX-5Mobile-App\rtx5-app
   ```

2. Run checks.

   ```powershell
   npm run typecheck
   npx expo-doctor
   ```

3. Build Android and iOS production binaries.

   ```powershell
   npx eas-cli@latest build --platform all --profile production
   ```

4. Android output is an `.aab` for Play Store.

5. iOS output is an `.ipa` for App Store Connect/TestFlight.

## Android Play Store Notes

Current Android package:

```text
com.rtx5.app
```

Current EAS upload key SHA1:

```text
53:7A:77:27:81:07:62:3C:0C:A9:B2:76:4E:CB:F2:A7:0F:7E:07:14
```

Google Play previously expected old upload key SHA1:

```text
FD:B1:C3:0D:67:E7:F1:BE:D0:58:B2:1B:78:73:1C:2F:F9:AA:EB:E7
```

Upload-key reset request has been submitted in Google Play Console.

After Google approves it, the Play Console upload key certificate should change to the EAS key:

```text
53:7A:77:27:81:07:62:3C:0C:A9:B2:76:4E:CB:F2:A7:0F:7E:07:14
```

Only after that, upload the Android `.aab` again.

## Credentials Needed

Do not write secret values in code or docs.

Credentials used:

- Expo/GitHub OTA:
  - GitHub repository secret named `EXPO_TOKEN`
- Android Play Store submission:
  - Google Play service account JSON, if using automatic EAS submit
  - Manual Play Console upload does not need this file
- iOS App Store submission:
  - Existing EAS/App Store Connect credentials are already configured

## Verify OTA On Phone

After OTA success:

1. Open the installed production app.
2. Wait 5-10 seconds.
3. Fully close the app.
4. Open it again.
5. Confirm the change appears.

Expo usually downloads the OTA on one launch and applies it on the next reload/restart.

## If OTA Fails

1. Open GitHub Actions.
2. Open failed `RTX5 OTA Update` run.
3. Read the failed step.
4. Common causes:
   - Missing or wrong `EXPO_TOKEN`.
   - TypeScript error.
   - Expo Doctor error.
   - Native-sensitive files changed.
5. Fix the issue, commit, and push again.

## Branch Meaning

- `main` publishes preview OTA.
- `staging` publishes staging OTA.
- `release` publishes production OTA.

For production phone app updates, use:

```text
release
```
