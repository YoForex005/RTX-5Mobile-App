# Phase 01 - Design System and App Shell

## Objective
Implement the dark themed design system and responsive shell to support near parity UI across phone and tablet.

## In Scope
- Theme tokens: colors, typography, spacing, radius, elevation.
- Reusable primitives: text, buttons, rows, cards, list items, badges.
- Bottom tab shell parity.
- Adaptive layout framework for tablet split panes.

## Out of Scope
- Feature-specific business behavior.
- Live data integrations.

## Exact Implementation Tasks
1. Define design tokens in a central theme module.
2. Build reusable primitives and wrappers.
3. Create shared price and PnL display components.
4. Implement tab icons, selected states, and safe-area handling.
5. Add tablet breakpoint utilities and split-pane scaffolds.
6. Build global sheet/modal presentation style matching reference app.

## API Dependencies
- None.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Dark theme visually matches target baseline.
- [ ] Shared components are used by all feature modules.
- [ ] Tablet and phone render without layout breakage.
- [ ] Modal/action sheet style parity achieved.
- [x] App identity assets use the RTX5 white mark with the green center `5` across Expo icon, dark splash/startup surface, adaptive icon, favicon, and in-app logo consumers.

## Test Checklist
- [ ] Snapshot tests for primitives.
- [ ] Visual regression checks for shell screens.
- [ ] Manual orientation test on tablet.
- [x] Manual asset reference and dimension verification for app identity assets.

## Exit Criteria
- UI foundation is complete and feature teams only consume shared components.

## Progress Notes
- 2026-05-25: Tightened the MT5-smooth ActionSheet path after device recheck. Shared sheets now virtualize action rows instead of mounting every item, intercept Android hardware Back while open, and support explicit touch-start activation for non-scrollable dropdown launchers that sit above native surfaces.
- 2026-05-25: Reworked shared ActionSheet interaction timing toward MT5-style first-frame behavior. Global sheets now normalize to instant open, seed visible opacity/translate in the first render, avoid Android native Modal geometry settle/slide paths, execute row actions immediately by default, and keep adaptive sheet floors stable without reflowing after paint.
- 2026-05-21: Replaced the referenced app identity assets with the dark-square RTX5 mark, white symbol, and green center `5` across the active Expo app assets and root Expo scaffold assets. Verified current logo consumers continue to reference the updated asset paths.
- 2026-05-21: Centralized in-app logo rendering through a shared `AppLogo` component, added a branded first-render startup surface, and aligned the native splash background with the supplied dark RTX5 logo.
