# RTX5 OTA and Release Guide

## OTA Strategy
Use EAS Update with three channels:
1. `preview` - QA and developer validation.
2. `staging` - internal beta users and release candidates.
3. `production` - controlled public rollout.

## Runtime Version Gating
- Every binary build must declare a runtime version.
- OTA bundle must only target matching runtime versions.
- Never promote OTA bundle across incompatible runtime groups.

## Release Status Notes
- 2026-06-11: Aligned the root Expo scaffold `app.json` orientation with the active app config by changing it from portrait-only to `default` for portrait and landscape support. The active `rtx5-app/app.json` already used `orientation: default`, so it was not changed. Orientation/native config changes require a new native binary build and must not be shipped as an OTA-only update.
- 2026-06-10: Published iOS-only production OTA display-version test `1.1.6` for the OTA-enabled iOS build `1.1.5 (23)`. Update group `108e4391-be4c-46d2-8831-b67541fdf44c`, iOS update `019eb163-4bde-7625-ae4b-68880e4e568b`, runtime `f4184b3e04e9e7200364ce9ab4dfd4ec18950364`, message `iOS OTA display version 1.1.6`. This intentionally does not change the native `app.json` version; it is an OTA-visible app label check.
- 2026-06-10: Created the OTA-enabled iOS production build path after the no-OTA iOS fix was verified. Build `de72ff78-0417-4e21-b9ce-833171064e58` (`1.1.5`, build `23`, runtime `f4184b3e04e9e7200364ce9ab4dfd4ec18950364`, artifact `https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/ttcD21JyMUABf5qHJjQm2N.ipa`) uses the normal `production` profile with Expo Updates enabled and was submitted to App Store Connect/TestFlight through EAS submission `1f9c0847-f858-4d3e-b1bc-fa38945cea0e`. Published matching iOS production OTA update group `a31a3f14-a33e-42a3-ac32-2ed3b8f05242` (`019eb14d-8cdd-75ce-b019-1f6539d539ed`) for the same runtime. TestFlight processing and iPhone OTA fetch/reopen validation remain pending.
- 2026-06-10: Created iOS no-OTA production build `ff562ad7-8be9-4bb6-b719-f488b31cb7db` (`1.1.5`, build `22`, runtime `e4742e46c961072f39776c78678b681b8c5d5b78`, artifact `https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/xwK6henEyp59tCS3ZmDBdg.ipa`) from the fixed startup/reopen code path and submitted it to App Store Connect/TestFlight through EAS submission `fb97d303-0248-4b99-9952-d381db6a5f0e`. This build uses the `production-no-ota` profile so native Expo Updates are disabled and the embedded bundle is the source of truth. Apple processing and iPhone close/reopen validation remain pending.
- 2026-06-10: Android `1.1.5` no-OTA build `16` was proven not to be failing from EAS Update/OTA: device startup diagnostics logged `updates.isEnabled: false`, no channel/runtime/update ID, and `disabledByEnv: true`. The crash was a bundled JS startup defect in `QuotesWebSocketService`, where `url` resolved before `failedBrokerSocketUrls` was initialized. Fixed Android no-OTA build `e0d111e8-2976-4921-8c25-2d4b67c5f997` (`versionCode` 19, artifact `https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/tLa64FJNE1g5bPHfcv14Dr.apk`) was installed over preserved device data and passed five open/home/reopen/force-stop/reopen cycles with no fatal logcat matches. iOS needs a fresh TestFlight build and the same reopen smoke before the platform gate is closed.
- 2026-06-10: Added a dynamic Expo config path for no-OTA production builds. Profiles that set `EXPO_PUBLIC_DISABLE_OTA_UPDATES=true` now compile with native Expo Updates disabled (`updates.enabled: false`) and the no-OTA EAS build scripts use `--clear-cache`; normal OTA-enabled profiles remain unchanged.
- 2026-06-03: Added GitHub Actions OTA automation. Pushes to `main`, `staging`, and `release` publish EAS Updates to `preview`, `staging`, and `production` respectively after dependency install, TypeScript, and Expo Doctor checks pass. Automatic OTA is blocked when native-sensitive files change. Native EAS builds were moved to manual GitHub workflow dispatch so normal JavaScript/UI pushes do not create separate Android/iOS binaries.
- 2026-06-03: Google Play Console rejected Android production AAB `application-721dff83-e80f-4c1b-8411-f89662c3b42e.aab` because the upload certificate does not match the app's registered upload key. Play expects SHA1 `FD:B1:C3:0D:67:E7:F1:BE:D0:58:B2:1B:78:73:1C:2F:F9:AA:EB:E7`; the EAS-signed AAB uses SHA1 `53:7A:77:27:81:07:62:3C:0C:A9:B2:76:4E:CB:F2:A7:0F:7E:07:14`. Earlier EAS production AABs `619457a1-cb5e-470a-91f7-63c11f96b94a` and `b6b1b052-ca41-4acb-808f-b2fb8e1e26ed` were checked and use the same rejected `53:7A...` certificate. Generated the current EAS public upload certificate at `.codex-tmp/play-upload-key-reset/rtx5-current-eas-upload-certificate.pem` for a Play Console upload-key reset if the original `FD:B1...` upload keystore is unavailable.
- 2026-06-03: Submitted iOS production build `ce6a24e1-cb82-4449-9ea8-b91691dbe3a1` (`1.0.0`, build `7`) to Apple App Store Connect/TestFlight using the existing EAS-hosted App Store Connect API key. EAS submission ID: `ef787048-dbce-4e3e-ae94-32ce63f47156`. Android Play submission was attempted for build `721dff83-e80f-4c1b-8411-f89662c3b42e` but is blocked because `rtx5-app/google-services.json` is missing; the configured file must be a Google Play service account JSON key.
- 2026-06-03: Created production EAS store builds for Android (`721dff83-e80f-4c1b-8411-f89662c3b42e`, AAB artifact `https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/f6jp52UHD8tuyZZrG75SyE.aab`) and iOS (`ce6a24e1-cb82-4449-9ea8-b91691dbe3a1`, IPA artifact `https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/rumRynbWti8iSAA7WgT9kc.ipa`). EAS remote app-version source auto-incremented Android `versionCode` from 5 to 6 and iOS `buildNumber` from 6 to 7. `npm run typecheck` passed before release evaluation. Production OTA publish was intentionally held because staging smoke validation, rollback validation, and mandatory security controls are not yet green.
- 2026-06-03: Created preview EAS builds for Android (`8b5e21ec-1462-43fa-8922-70572f5a69cb`) and iOS (`76cdd877-eeaf-4f85-9583-6ada486fad1b`) on `@chinese-hedger/rtx5-app`. Published preview OTA update group `f4c2885f-2cd6-46cb-b1dc-6bf64cf3bc04` for runtime version `1.0.0` on Android (`019e8d0c-b770-7c1b-8379-8045255f10a3`) and iOS (`019e8d0c-b770-7dd3-81bf-3e3a16769f3f`) with message `Preview OTA update 2026-06-03`. Device smoke validation is still pending before staging promotion.
- 2026-05-22: Relinked the Expo/EAS project to `@chinese-hedger/rtx5-app` with project ID `092a58db-dea9-469a-a383-f27300598812` and OTA URL `https://u.expo.dev/092a58db-dea9-469a-a383-f27300598812`. Created the `development`, `preview`, `staging`, and `production` update channels with same-name branches on the new project; no OTA bundles were published.
- 2026-05-21: Added an Android `production-apk` EAS profile for installable internal APK output on the `production` channel with the production EAS environment. Cloud build could not start because the Expo account has exhausted Android builds on the Free plan for this month; quota resets on 2026-06-01.
- 2026-05-06: Android production binary identifier is now `com.rtx5.app`. The `production` EAS profile still targets `channel: production` with Android `buildType: app-bundle`. EAS cloud build remains blocked locally until `eas-cli` is available in an authenticated/networked Expo environment; local Gradle AAB creation now reaches dependency resolution but cannot download required Maven artifacts under sandbox network restrictions.
- 2026-05-06: OTA publish scripts now route `preview`, `staging`, and `production` through `scripts/eas-update.js`, which forces `eas update --platform all` on the selected channel with CI/non-interactive fingerprint settings. Expo config is native-only (`ios`, `android`) with runtime version still gated by `appVersion`; web OTA output is intentionally excluded from the app config and EAS upload ignore list.
- 2026-05-05: Android production EAS build profile now targets Play Store output with `distribution: store`, production channel, and `android.buildType: app-bundle`. Runtime-version gating remains required for any OTA published to the production channel.
- 2026-05-05: Added native-only launch OTA check using `expo-updates` channel and runtime metadata. The app checks only on EAS channels (`preview`, `staging`, `production`) when `expo-updates` is enabled, then fetches and reloads a compatible update selected by EAS Update runtime gating.
