>
> Live EAS state last verified: `2026-08-05` (Asia/Calcutta).

This file is the quick production reference. The detailed compatibility,
validation, binary, and release history source of truth is:

- [`docs/guide/OTA_PRODUCTION_BASELINE.md`](docs/guide/OTA_PRODUCTION_BASELINE.md)
- [`WORKSPACE_TOOLCHAIN.json`](WORKSPACE_TOOLCHAIN.json)
- [`docs/guide/NEW_WINDOWS_MACHINE_SETUP.md`](docs/guide/NEW_WINDOWS_MACHINE_SETUP.md)

Read and verify the production baseline before publishing from any computer. Do not
run production EAS commands from the repository root; the production Expo app
is under `rtx5-app`.

## Current Production Answer - OTA `1.1.34`

This is the exact OTA that is currently live. These identifiers are recorded so
the next agent can understand the existing Android and iOS release; they are not
instructions to publish it again.

## Instructions for the Next OTA Agent

No next OTA is authorized or published by this documentation change. When the
user later explicitly requests another OTA, follow this decision table:

| Release field | Reuse from `1.1.34`? | Required next-agent action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Expo owner/project, EAS project ID, update URL | **Normally yes** | Verify them live before publishing. |
| Channel, branch, EAS environment | **Normally yes: `production`** | Verify the channel is active and still points to the production branch. |
| Android runtime | **Conditional only** | Target `30cba832...` again only if the intended installed Android binary uses it and the exact release source passes every safety check. |
| iOS runtime | **Conditional only** | Target `ef38da27...` again only if the intended installed iOS binary uses it and the exact release source passes every safety check. |
| Android/iOS update group | **No** | EAS must generate a new group for each new platform publication. |
| Android/iOS update ID | **No** | EAS must generate a new update ID for each new platform publication. |
| Timestamp, manifest, dashboard URL | **No** | Record the newly generated values after the publish succeeds. |
| OTA-visible version and message | **No** | Use only the new version and message explicitly requested by the user. |
| Release source commit/status | **Re-determine** | Record the exact validated source used for the new OTA. |
| OTA safety-comparison base | **Re-determine** | Select and record the reviewed compatible base; do not copy `2975156...` automatically. |
| Target binary/build record | **Re-confirm** | Verify the installed/store build and its platform runtime. |

The current `1.1.34` group and update IDs are historical evidence only. Never
pass them to a future publish command and never describe them as the IDs for the
next OTA. Keep the top of this file at `1.1.34` until both newly requested
platform updates have actually been published and verified through live EAS.

## Production Destination — Reuse After Live Verification

| Field | Production value |
| --- | --- |
| Working directory | `rtx5-app` |
| Expo owner/project | `yoforex/rtx5-app` |
| EAS project ID | `092a58db-dea9-469a-a383-f27300598812` |
| Update URL | `https://u.expo.dev/092a58db-dea9-469a-a383-f27300598812` |
| Channel | `production` |
| Channel ID | `019e4e07-2048-7da5-b4e7-e6d115eac5f2` |
| Branch | `production` |
| Branch ID | `019e4e07-1eb3-7000-bd63-d79591ead50e` |
| EAS environment | `production` |
| Runtime policy | `fingerprint` |
| Effective Expo config | `rtx5-app/app.config.js`, based on `rtx5-app/app.json` |
| Platform method | Validate and publish Android and iOS separately |

These values identify the production destination. Confirm them with live EAS
before every publish; do not assume a saved snapshot is still current.

## Critical Rule for the Next OTA

The two runtime values above are **conditional compatibility values**. Use the
same Android or iOS runtime again only when all of the following are proven:

1. The intended installed/store binary uses that exact platform runtime.
2. The exact release source passes the OTA safety check with zero
   native-impacting changes.
3. The resolved runtime and live production state have been verified.

If any check fails, stop and create/validate the required native build. Never
force an old runtime merely to make an incompatible source publish.

The following `1.1.34` values are **historical and must not be reused**:

- Update group
- Update ID
- Created timestamp
- Manifest URL
- Dashboard URL
- Version and release message

EAS automatically creates a new group, update ID, timestamp, manifest URL, and
dashboard URL for every new platform publication. They cannot be selected in
advance. If the user later explicitly authorizes a `1.1.35` OTA, it may
conditionally target the same compatible runtimes, but it must receive new
Android and iOS group/update IDs. This file does not mark `1.1.35` as published.

The release source commit/status, safety-comparison base, and target binary must
also be freshly determined and recorded for every OTA; do not copy them without
verification.

## Required Next-OTA Record

Before publishing:

1. For the OTA-visible version number, edit
   `rtx5-app/src/config/appDisplayVersion.ts` and
   `rtx5-app/src/config/appDisplayVersion.test.ts` after confirming the
   requested version. This does not limit the other validated application code
   included in the OTA.
2. Verify the live channel, production environment, target installed binaries,
   native-change safety, Android runtime, and iOS runtime.
3. Publish each platform only to its verified runtime.

After publishing, record here and in the production baseline:

- Version and exact release source/status
- Android runtime, group, update ID, timestamp, message, manifest, and dashboard
- iOS runtime, group, update ID, timestamp, message, manifest, and dashboard
- Target binary/build record and safety-comparison base
- Validation results and physical-device delivery confirmation
